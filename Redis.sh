#Usually Redis opens the port only to localhost(127.0.0.1), meaning this service can be accessed by the application that is hosted on this server only. However, we need to access this service to be accessed by another server, So we need to change the config accordingly.
 #
 #Update listen address from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 in /etc/redis/redis.conf
 #
 #Update protected-mode from yes to no in /etc/redis/redis.conf

 #Start & Enable Redis Service
 systemctl enable redis
 systemctl start redis
